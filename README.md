# SJTUBeamer 🤓
Welcome! 🥳
This is the beamer template exclusively for Shanghai Jiaotong University students to give a speech on group meeting or course project.

## Usage 🧰
You can directly download the zip file from github and upload it to https://latex.sjtu.edu.cn to use this template. Latex snippets are listed as examples in the [main.tex](https://github.com/cascades-sjtu/SJTU-Beamer/main.tex). Both english and chinese are supported.

## Design Philosophy 💭
* To design the template as simple as possible, since everyone can modify it according to their preferences with a little knowledge of latex syntax and beamer.
* The theme is my favorate, you can change it to other [themes](https://deic-web.uab.cat/~iblanes/beamer_gallery/) or make a small modification.
* The main color **beaver** is mostly like **SJTU-Red** which is more often seen in official occasion.
* The SJTU logo and the background is downloaded from https://vi.sjtu.edu.cn.

## Contribution 👷
